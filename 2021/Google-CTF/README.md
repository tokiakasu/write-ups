# Google CTF

### Organizer details
> Google will run the 2021 CTF competition in two parts: an online jeopardy-CTF competition, and second contest open only to the top 16 teams. "Capture The Flag" (CTF) competitions are not related to running outdoors or playing first-person shooters. Instead, they consist of a set of computer security puzzles (or challenges) involving reverse-engineering, memory corruption, cryptography, web technologies, and more. When players solve them they get a "flag," a secret string which can be exchanged for points. The more points a team earns, the higher up it moves in rank.
